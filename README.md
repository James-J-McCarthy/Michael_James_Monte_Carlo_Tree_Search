# Michael_James_Monte_Carlo_Tree_Search

## How to use: 

Open repo in python editor. All code is in Python. 

Run the file titled main.py to start the program. The computer will makes moves 
displayed as a print out to the terminal. 

the algorithm make moves in response by collecting user input via input().

Your input must be in the format 'rowNumber columnNumber' with a space in between, where
the top right corner of the board is input: '1 3'

the program stops once the game ends. 

wrong inputs will not be parsed. 

if the game ends and input is still open, it sometimes crashes right away, in this case start it over. 

at anypoint, enter a non space input like so: '1n4' and your move input will be ignored
in favor of a print out of all current children states' boards and corresponding scores.
